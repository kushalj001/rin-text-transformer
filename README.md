# Adapting RINs for text

* Files with `annotated*` are files taken from lucidrains's image RIN codebase. These files have annotations/notes that I made while reading the code.
* `rin_text.py` is the code I am currently working on, which adapts the image codebase to text.
* The jupyter notebook is basically where I am actively working/experimenting. For now I am just appending whatever I write and test in the notebook to the file above. The .py file cannot be executed in the current state. More notes can be found in the notebook.
